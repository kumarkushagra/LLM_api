# LLM API Implementation

This repository provides implementations of SeamlessM4T pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) by facebook, demonstrating it's usage for tasks such as text generation, conversion and translation.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Models**: Implementations of pre-trained LLMs for diverse natural language processing tasks.
- **API Integration**: Examples showcasing how to interact with these models via API calls (only for MedLLM).

## Google Colab Notebook

To experiment with the implementations, access :-
